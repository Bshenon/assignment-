        <p class="letter">Udawalawe National Park just south of Sri Lanka’s central mountains, is a large reserve made up of 119 square miles of grassland, scrub jungle and riverine forest. The main attraction of the park is the large concentration of Asian elephants found here, Udawalawe is home to over 400 of these gentle giants and it is almost guaranteed to see them whilst on safari. A favourite hangout for the herds of elephants is the Walawe Reservoir where the creatures come to drink during times of water scarcity.

            Udawalawe National Park is also home to some other exciting wildlife including the mugger crocodile, sambar, spotted and barking deer, wild boar, water buffalo and jackal whilst the birding is excellent with nearly 200 species recorded. November to March is the optimal time for birdwatching expeditions with the chance to spot exciting raptors such as the changeable hawk-eagle, serpent eagle and grey-headed fish eagle.</p>

        <p class="letter">Declared a Nature Reserve in 1988 and then upgraded to national park status in 2002, the Hikkaduwa National Park in the southern province is one of only two marine national parks in Sri Lanka. Although the southern coastline is home to many coral reefs, the reefs in Hikkaduwa are the most diverse and accessible and offer some of the country’s best snorkelling and diving opportunities.

            The main reef of Hikkaduwa sits in a sheltered lagoon, it is a typical fringing reef with an average depth of about 5 metres. The coral is colourful and diverse with around 60 different species including boulder and encrusting corals, small-strands of Acropora coral and the cabbage-like Montipora coral. The seagrass is home to sea turtles, whilst tropical reef fish such as parrot fish, angel fish and butterfly fish skirt through the corals. Along the outer slope of the reef, blacktip reef sharks can be found along with hawksbill and green turtles.</p>
